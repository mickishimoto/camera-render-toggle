Camera Render Toggle (Active vs Others) - Safe

This Blender add-on allows you to quickly toggle rendering visibility
of cameras in your scene:

- Press the toggle button (or run the operator) to *disable rendering*
  for all cameras **except** the active one.
- Press it again to *enable rendering* for **all** cameras.

This is useful for managing multiple cameras during production or export.
It also disables the collections containing those cameras to ensure render exclusion.

Compatible with Blender 4.0+
